1.  COMPONENTS
    Component Nesting
    Component Reusability
    Component Configuration

2.  Rule of states
    Only usble with class components
    You will confuse props with state
    'State' is a JS object that contains data relevant to a component
    Updating 'State' on a component causes the component to (almost) instantly rerender
    State must be initialized when a component is created
    State can only be updated using the function 'setState'

    class App extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { lat: null, errorMessage: ""};

    window.navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
    position => {
    this.setState({lat: position.coords.latitude});

        },
        err => {
            this.setState({errorMessage: err.message})
        }

    )
    }


        render() {
            return (
                <div> hi there </div>
            )
        }

    }
